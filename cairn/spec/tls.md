# TLS

The provider-agnostic vocabulary a consumer fills in to say how a session should be secured, and the two backends that read it. The backend types (`rustls`, `native-tls`) SHALL NOT escape this crate: a consumer names what it wants, never the library that will do it.

### Requirement: Provider selection

The provider SHALL be selectable, and an unset provider SHALL fall back to the first enabled feature, rustls with ring first, then rustls with aws-lc-rs, then native-tls.

Asking for a provider whose feature is off SHALL fail with a message naming the missing feature rather than silently using the other one.

#### Scenario: A build without native-tls
- GIVEN a consumer selecting the native-tls provider
- WHEN the crate was built without that feature
- THEN the connect fails, saying which cargo feature is missing

### Requirement: Trust

Server certificates SHALL be verified against the platform trust store by default.

A consumer MAY name one extra certificate as a PEM path. Under rustls it SHALL be pinned to the server's leaf and also offered as an extra trust anchor, which is what a self-signed CA-marked leaf (Proton Bridge) needs, a normal chain build rejecting it. Under native-tls it SHALL be added as a root certificate.

#### Scenario: A pinned self-signed leaf
- GIVEN a PEM holding the certificate a local bridge presents as its leaf
- WHEN the session is opened against that bridge
- THEN the certificate is accepted verbatim, where a chain build would have refused it

### Requirement: ALPN

ALPN identifiers SHALL be offered during a rustls handshake when the consumer lists any, and an empty list SHALL skip ALPN negotiation.

They live on the rustls options rather than beside the provider choice because native-tls exposes no ALPN switch, so the field would promise something one backend cannot keep. Protocol crates ship their own default identifiers for a config layer to copy in.
